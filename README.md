Welcome to Andrew Cheng's CISCO Stock Ticker programming challenge. Use the form on the navigation bar to your left to add a stock and to visit stocks in your Watch List. I used Stock Quote gem to retrieve stock information from IEX's API. Devise was used for user authentication and BootStrap was used for aesthetic styling. HighCharts.js was used for the graph.

Testing:

End-to-end testing is configured for use with RSpec/Capybara.
Run the command 'rspec -fd' to run included tests.
